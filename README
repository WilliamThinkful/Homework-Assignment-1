The website performed as expected on a desktop, however, there were numerous design issues on smaller screens.
The main purpose was to make this website function as expected on smaller screens while still keeping a similar design as the desktop view.
Main issue with smaller screens resided in the benefits column on the right side. This had to be moved under the main content to display properly.
All text and images utilized a flexbox design and were aligned into columns and centered to be more mobile friendly. 
Some padding and margins were adjusted to improve the column view. 
Main image wasn't adjusted as smaller screens tend to center in on the focal point of the image, however, this could be adjusted to fit the screen if preferred.
No functionality adjustments were made.
